# Cleaning-NLSY79-Data
This project focused on tidying and cleaning the height data for respondents to the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth of 1979 (NLSY79). This project also focused on visualizing the distributions of height in our cleaned data by comparing the height distributions for males and females. The NLSY79 is a longitudinal project that follows the lives of a sample of American youth born between 1957-64.
